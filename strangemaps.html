 <center><h2>satellite maps have been making things easier for mankind since they existed. We no longer have to use complex geodetic methods. However, these maps also have their dark side. Every place in the world loses its privacy.
 Which is a problem even for those quite influential people from the government who want to hide something. That's why places that are censored quite often appear on maps. Yes, sometimes there is an explanation, but sometimes you find it quite suspicious when you find a censored place in the middle of Antarctica (You will hear more about this place in Antarctica in this article).</h2></center>

 <center><h2>The photo you can see above has several oddities. First, it can be seen that two pictures were used on the spot, one near the place where the censorship is and the other captures everything around. The second oddity is that there were points for google street view around, but now these points are not working .The nearest working point is about 2400 km at Showa Station Antarctica
(It's been a few hours since I wrote this part and during that time I've been trying to figure something out and found something out)I tried to find another satellite map that would clarify something and I actually found one. However, what was on it caused even more questions
.In addition, an island was added to this map near the censored place. I looked on Google Maps and the island was not there .
I understand that if it was made of ice, it might have melted, but the pictures showed that it was made of land.So which of these two maps is lying?Two days have passed since I wrote the last part of the article and I have already started writing other articles. One was about Skinwalker's Ranch and I needed to use satellite maps in it. I used satellite maps from Bing (Microsoft).
I looked at the censored place on these maps and it was censored completely differently than on Google Maps. These satellite maps are below this article so you can look at the place yourself and compare it to the image from Google Maps at the beginning of the article</h2></center>

  <center><h2>This place is interesting because I got a tip about it from a witness. The witness described military vehicles around a silo in Wheatland, this silo was also censored on Google Maps in the past years. So what happened there? There was an army there which is always suspicious plus the fact that.</h2></center>
