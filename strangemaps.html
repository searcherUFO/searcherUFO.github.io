 <center><h2>satellite maps have been making things easier for mankind since they existed. We no longer have to use complex geodetic methods. However, these maps also have their dark side. Every place in the world loses its privacy.
 Which is a problem even for those quite influential people from the government who want to hide something. That's why places that are censored quite often appear on maps. Yes, sometimes there is an explanation, but sometimes you find it quite suspicious when you find a censored place in the middle of Antarctica (You will hear more about this place in Antarctica in this article).</h2></center>

    <center><h2>The photo you can see above has several oddities. First, it can be seen that two pictures were used on the spot, one near the place where the censorship is and the other captures everything around. The second oddity is that there were points for google street view around, but now these points are not working .The nearest working point is about 2400 km at Showa Station Antarctica</h2></center>
