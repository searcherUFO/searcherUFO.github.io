<h2>The UFO appeared over Karlovy Vary the day after it appeared in Cheb. Unfortunately, unlike Cheb, we do not have footage of the UFO from Karlovy Vary from this day. <a href="ufocheb.html"><button style="background-color:white; border-color:white;"><p style="font-size:10px; ">UFO Cheb</p></ button></a>).But there is another case. The family filmed a UFO flying over Karlovy Vary.
I saw this video there was something in the sky and I don't know why but the cameraman zoomed in until the end of the video. In the short part of the video where the UFO was zoomed in it was clear that, despite what the cameraman thought, it was not a plane. The footage showed that the object had no wings.<h2>
