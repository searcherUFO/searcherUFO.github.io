<h2>Chuck Zukowski was a sheriff's deputy in El Paso County and was fired for investigating UFOs. He often got involved in mysterious cases of cattle mutilation, which is not uncommon in America. He talked a lot about it, and that's probably why they got rid of him. (More about cases of cattle mutilation can be found on our page Extraterrestrial Experiments on Animals)</h2>
