      <h2>The Simulation Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>Philosopher Nick Bostrom proposed that if advanced civilizations can simulate entire worlds—and if they do—then statistically, it’s more likely that we’re in a simulation than base reality. Think of it this way: if there’s one real universe, but billions of simulations, which are you more likely to be in?</p>

      <h2>Evidence from Physics</h2>
      <p>Some physicists have pointed out strange digital-like properties of our universe. For example, the Planck length—below which no smaller unit of space exists—resembles the resolution limit of a rendered simulation. Plus, quantum particles behave differently when observed. Could that be a rendering optimization?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Glitches</h2>
      <p>Déjà vu, lost time, Mandela effects… some argue these are "glitches in the matrix"—moments where the simulation corrects itself. While not scientific proof, they align with behaviors seen in complex systems and virtual environments.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>AI and the Rise of the Simulators</h2>
      <p>We are now creating hyper-realistic virtual worlds powered by artificial intelligence. If this trend continues, we’ll eventually have the power to create entire conscious beings in digital realities. Would they know they’re simulated? Do we?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Are There Signs We're Being Watched?</h2>
      <p>If we’re in a simulation, who’s running it—and why? Is it for research? Entertainment? Are there rules? Some scientists propose that if we were close to discovering the truth, the simulation might self-correct or even shut down. Let’s hope this article doesn’t trigger that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>So… What Should You Do?</h2>
      <p>Whether simulated or not, your thoughts and actions still matter. A simulated consciousness is still a consciousness. So choose meaning, explore ideas, and—most importantly—question everything. Because if reality is an illusion, the search for truth becomes the most real thing of all.</p>
