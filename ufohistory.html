<h2>Aliens. Our knowledge about them is zero. But what if we actually know more than we think.</h2>

<h2>The Bible, our oldest source of stories about the creation of the world. At least from the perspective of a person living thousands of years ago. Today some of us have a different opinion about this book. But how did this change begin. We have to go back a few years to the story of Erich von Daniken (I think most of you who are here know the story, so I will take it quickly and briefly)
  .After reading parts of the Bible, a young student of theology, Erich, came to the conclusion that it is all some kind of strange, he created a theory that what the ancient people described were actually only experiences with UFOs similar to those you can share on this website. (If you are new to this site, you can share your experiences with UFOs in <a href="comments.html"><button style="background-color: white; border-color:white;"><p style="font-size:10px; ">Comment Box</p></button></a>)So he published a book about the gods being aliens which with a lot of people at that time not very pleased
 Which, apart from the fact that he probably really found out the truth and that some states probably didn't like the fact that he was talking about things they had been hiding for years, was the reason for his arrest and subsequent sentencing to 3 years in prison (It is possible that only the government and the church were to blame because officially he was convicted for taking money from the hotel, which was probably true because even Erich did not deny it
.Still, many people think that the two reasons are related.) The attempt to get rid of Erich did not work because he wrote other books in prison. Then everyone knows the story he became a writer and a program was made about his theory known as Ancient Aliens.</h2>

<h2>So where do I start? I'd start with the Bible so I'll give you excerpts from the Bible and add to them what they might actually represent.Genesis 2,21.So the Lord God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep. When he fell asleep, he took one of his ribs and filled the place with his body.Doesn't sound like a modern day surgery to you?Put to sleep, remove a rib
.(Malachi 3:10)"Bring all the tithes into the granary, so that there is food in my temple. Only test me in this, says the Lord of hosts, whether I will not open the vents of heaven for you and pour out a blessing on you that you will not even take away.".What is vent of heaven?The heavenly vent is supposed to be something from which god pours blessings on people.It sounds strange.
 Overall, the story of the Bible, which is entirely based on some kind of heavenly ruler, sounds strange.Furthermore, we could solve Jesus' departure to heaven after a ray of light, but Jesus does not fit into the theory of Ancient aliens, and therefore Jesus' strange abandonment of the earth is just my opinion.
  Apart from the written evidence of the Bible, however, it does not have much tangible evidence. That is why I would like to move to civilizations that existed even before the Bible.</h2>
