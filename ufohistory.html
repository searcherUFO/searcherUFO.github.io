<h2>The Bible, our oldest source of stories about the creation of the world. At least from the perspective of a person living thousands of years ago. Today some of us have a different opinion about this book. But how did this change begin. We have to go back a few years to the story of Erich von Daniken (I think most of you who are here know the story, so I will take it quickly and briefly)
.After reading parts of the Bible, a young student of theology, Erich, came to the conclusion that it is all some kind of strange, he created a theory that what the ancient people described were actually only experiences with UFOs similar to those you can share on this website. (If you are new to this site, you can share your experiences with UFOs in <a href="comments.html"><button style="background-color: white; border-color:white;"><p style="font-size:10px; ">Comment Box</p></button></a>)So he published a book about the gods being aliens which with a lot of people at that time</h2>
