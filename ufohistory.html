<h2>The Bible, our oldest source of stories about the creation of the world. At least from the perspective of a person living thousands of years ago. Today some of us have a different opinion about this book. But how did this change begin. We have to go back a few years to the story of Erich von Daniken (I think most of you who are here know the story, so I will take it quickly and briefly)
  .After reading parts of the Bible, a young student of theology, Erich, came to the conclusion that it is all some kind of strange, he created a theory that what the ancient people described were actually only experiences with UFOs similar to those you can share on this website. (If you are new to this site, you can share your experiences with UFOs in <a href="comments.html"><button style="background-color: white; border-color:white;"><p style="font-size:10px; ">Comment Box</p></button></a>)So he published a book about the gods being aliens which with a lot of people at that time not very pleased
 Which, apart from the fact that he probably really found out the truth and that some states probably didn't like the fact that he was talking about things they had been hiding for years, was the reason for his arrest and subsequent sentencing to 3 years in prison (It is possible that only the government and the church were to blame because officially he was convicted for taking money from the hotel, which was probably true because even Erich did not deny it
.Still, many people think that the two reasons are related.) The attempt to get rid of Erich did not work because he wrote other books in prison. Then everyone knows the story he became a writer and a program was made about his theory known as Ancient Aliens.
