Not everyone has the patience for chess, but almost everyone can learn it. The game itself is both complex and simple at the same time. Recently, online chess has become quite popular. You can play them against other players or against bots. Some online chess games may even have bots that will teach you chess. Chess has relatively simple rules, but there are also lesser-known parts that not many people know about. The game takes place on a simple board of 8x8 squares. Each square has a name.</h2></center><center><canvas id="chess"></canvas>

</center><center><h2>The name of the square on the chessboard is derived from the X and Y axis. X is A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H and Y is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. This means that, for example, A1 is in the corner. There are a total of 64 squares on the chessboard, of which 32 are occupied by game pieces, that is 1/2 of the chessboard. There are 6 types of figures.</h2></center><center><UFO-Text style="font-size:120px">Pawn♟︎</UFO-Text></center><center><h2>The pawn is a basic piece and both players have eight of them. A pawn can move forward or diagonally if it has a chance to pick up an opponent's piece. If the pawn is in row 2A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H, it can move two squares forward.</h2></center><center><UFO-Text style="font-size:120px">Knight♞</UFO-Text></center><center><h2>A knight also known as a horse is a figure on squares 1B and 1G, the knight moves according to the shape of a kind of "L". At the very first move at the beginning of the game, you have a choice whether to move with a pawn or a knight, you dont have any other options. A knight can move on both black and white squares (For example, a bishop can only move on squares of the color he started on).</h2></center><center><UFO-Text style="font-size:120px">Rook♜</UFO-Text></center><center><h2>Rook is a piece that can only move forward, backward or sideways. the figure looks like a tower. The Rook is located on squares 1A and 1H. The rook can move on black squares as well as white squares. Rook is good if you want to encircle the opponent's king.</h2></center><center><UFO-Text style="font-size:120px">Bishop♝</UFO-Text></center><center><h2>Bishop is the only piece that can only move according to the color it started on. Each player has two bishops, one bishop will move on white squares and the other on black squares. Bishops are located on squares 1C and 1F. Bishop can move diagonally to the lower left side, diagonally to the lower right side, diagonally to the upper right side and diagonally to the upper left side. A bishop from 1C can never pick up an opponent's bishop from 1C, and it's the same with 1F. One of the two bishops is located next to the queen and the other next to the king.</h2></center><center><UFO-Text style="font-size:120px">Queen & King</UFO-Text></center><center><h2>These two figures are probably the most important. If the king reaches the so-called checkmate, then the player loses the game. The king can move forward, backward, left, right, diagonally up to the right, diagonally up to the left, diagonally down to the left and diagonally down to the right. It cannot move more than one square. If your king flips over, you lose the game, but this does not apply to online chess. With the king and the rook you can make a so-called castling. The queen can move in the same directions as the king but without the limited number of squares. If you lose a queen, you can return it if your pawn reaches the end of the board. If your pawn reaches the end of the board, you can choose the figure you need.</h2></center><center><a href="bestthree.html"><button class="UFO-LinkButton">TOP 3</button></a><a href="index.html"><button class="UFO-LinkButton">2Dvs3D</button></a></center></div></center>
