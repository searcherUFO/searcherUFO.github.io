First, you don't need to download and update them. Every game, especially the graphics-intensive ones, slow down your computer and take up a lot of space. There are a lot of 3D Browser Games with fairly good graphics that you can play. Second, you don't have to log in to many Browser Games. If you have to log in to every game, it becomes annoying after a while, although nowadays services like Steam make it easier, it is still problematic in some games. The third advantage is that because there are ads in Browser Games so you don't have to pay for most of them.</h1></center>
<center><h2>3.OnlineChess&#9817;</h2></center><center><h1>Online Chess is a very good way to learn chess. There are many websites where you can play chess. You can play chess with a bot or you can play against another player. Many of these sites also have chess learning programs. The game of Chess is based on simple logic, you have a chess board of 8x8 squares. Every square on board has a name.</h1></center>
<center><canvas id="chess"></canvas>
<script>class Board {
  constructor(config) {
    this.options = {
      selector: document.querySelector("#board"),
      width: 400,
      size: 8,
      light: 'white',
      dark: 'black'
    };
    if(config) Object.assign(this.options, this.options, config);
    this.draw();
  }

  draw() {
    let el = this.options.selector;
    let ctx = el.getContext("2d");
    let squareWidth = this.options.width / this.options.size;
    let totalSquares = Math.pow(this.options.size, 2);
    let i, x, y = -1;
    
    el.width = this.options.width;
    el.height = this.options.width;
    
    for (i = 0; i < totalSquares; i++) {
      x++;
      if (i % this.options.size == 0) {
        y++; 
        x = 0;
      }     
      
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.rect(x * squareWidth, y * squareWidth, squareWidth, squareWidth);
      ctx.fillStyle = (x + y) % 2 ? this.options.dark : this.options.light; 
      ctx.fill();
    }

</center><center><h1>There are 6 types of 16 figures in the game. The tower figure can only move forward, sideways and backwards. The shooter figure can move diagonally. The horse figure moves according to a kind of "L" pattern. The queen piece can move as a rook and bishop together. The king piece can move one square to the sides next to itself. The pawn piece can move forward or diagonally up when it can pick up another piece. The aim of this game is to make a so-called checkmate which prevent the king piece from continuing to move without
received by the opponent.</h1></center>
<center><h2>2.Agar.io</h2></center>
<center><h1>Agar.io used to be a very popular game. Nowadays, only a small number of people play it, but it deserves to be labeled as one of the best Browser Games. In the game, you play for a circle that keeps getting bigger by eating points and opponents. There are four modes in the game, FFA, Team, Battle royale, and experimental. As for the components, the only difference is in the experimental, there are also red cells. If you are smaller than a red cell and enter it, it will eat you and offer other players to collect the points you had and add a little to them. If you are the same size as the red cell, nothing will happen to you, but if you are bigger, the circle will turn into several smaller circles. In the experimental mode, you can also move the green cells after the first shot. In Agar.io there are also skins that you buy with the coins you collect. Agar.io is not just a browser game, you can also download it to your phone.</h1></center>
