<h2>The Black Pyramid in Alaska, it is possible that you have never heard of it. If you had not heard of it, you probably would not have entered it into my search engine. If this is not the first article from my site that you are reading, then you know that I always let site visitors involved in the search for the truth, and therefore I always try to provide you with as much information as possible about the topic under discussion. The first information is the coordinates. 63.201493, -156.086162 should be the coordinates of the Black Pyramid in Alaska.
You can enter it into the online satellite map. If you do so, you will see an ordinary Alaskan forest, why should there be a Black Pyramid in this particular place? These coordinates should be some kind of leaked information. Another strange thing about this case is that the place is on a satellite image from 2022 covered by a cloud. Have you ever seen a place covered by a cloud on google maps? Well it may be a coincidence or a mistake but why is only part of the place covered by the cloud if I if they had enough pictures without clouds at a place a little further away, they must also have had enough pictures without clouds at the other place.<h2>
