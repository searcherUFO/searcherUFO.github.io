      <h2>Is Free Will an Illusion?</h2>
      <p>You may think you clicked this page by choice, but according to neuroscience and quantum mechanics, your decision was influenced long before your conscious mind caught up. Studies have shown that brain activity indicating a decision begins up to seven seconds before you're aware of making a choice. That means your brain decided to click—your consciousness is just along for the ride.</p>

      <h2>The Science of Decision and Destiny</h2>
      <p>In 2008, neuroscientists at the Max Planck Institute discovered that by monitoring brain activity, they could predict a person’s decision before they even realized it. Combine that with quantum theory’s idea that multiple outcomes coexist until observed, and you’ve got a strange reality: every click, every choice, might already be woven into a vast web of probability you’re just discovering one moment at a time.</p>

      <h2>You and the Multiverse: Infinite Versions of This Click</h2>
      <p>According to the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, every possible outcome of a decision actually occurs—just in separate, parallel universes. In one version, you never clicked this page. In another, you clicked and left immediately. But here, you stayed. Which means in this reality, it *was* your destiny.</p>

      <h2>Chaos, Patterns, and the Illusion of Randomness</h2>
      <p>Chaos theory teaches us that even seemingly random events can follow hidden patterns. The butterfly effect suggests that a small change (like a click) can set off a cascade of consequences. You clicking this article could be the start of a new chain reaction. A new obsession with science. A career shift. A conversation that changes everything. Not by magic—but by math.</p>

      <h2>Are You Being Watched by an Algorithm?</h2>
      <p>Before you clicked, an algorithm likely decided you were the type of person who *would* click. Based on behavior, timing, and emotional cues, modern AI can predict and manipulate human actions at scale. That raises a philosophical question: If a machine knew you’d click—was it your choice, or its programming?</p>

      <h2>This Click is a Quantum Event</h2>
      <p>In quantum physics, observation changes reality. So you reading this page—right now—isn’t just passive. It’s participatory. You are collapsing wave functions, choosing one version of reality over another. That’s not metaphor. That’s physics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>The Takeaway: You Were Always Meant to Be Here</h2>
      <p>Whether it was chaos, science, fate, or an algorithm that led you here—something did. You could’ve scrolled past. You didn’t. And that means this isn’t just a page. It’s a turning point, however small. Every click creates a future. You’re in it now.</p>
