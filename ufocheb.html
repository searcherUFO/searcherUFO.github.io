<center><h2>The UFO in Cheb was one of the quite unusual cases because, compared to America, UFO sightings in the Czech Republic are almost zero. On February 14, at 7:45 p.m., a resident of Cheb saw a UFO from the window of his apartment.
It was yellow-orange and did not make sounds. (UFOs do not make sounds in most statements from witnesses) Another person who saw the UFO managed to take a picture of it.</h2></center>

<center><h2>Well, every time I tell you about a case, I also give you space to try to solve it and find the truth. So I started searching. I found a lot of interesting information, and I was most interested in how big a role this city played in World War II. we dealt with the UFO occurrence in Bariloche, where Adolf Hitler was supposed to live after the end of the war. Could something similar have happened in Cheb?
The answer is yes, and the evidence points to it. During the Second World War, there was an autumn factory for the production of airplanes at this place, and surprisingly they took and orders from the Germans. The strange thing is that this factory never officially existed. Most factories in the Czech Republic are already declassified, why not this one. I found some rumors that flying saucers were supposed to be produced there! Personally, I think that if he had to the technology Adolf Hitler approached thus came from real parts of an alien flying saucer.</h2></center>
