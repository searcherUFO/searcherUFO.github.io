<h2>I was really looking forward to writing about Skinwalkers Ranch because it is my favorite alien legend. The best thing about Skinwalkers Ranch is that there is a lot of data from this place recently. Why is there a lot of data at this time to explain it to you, we have to go back to the mysterious history of Skinwalker's Ranch.
Skinwalker's Ranch was originally a Ranch owned by civilians, but after the owners complained about unexplained phenomena and frequent UFO sightings, they decided to sell this Ranch. Then the story becomes mysterious because the Ranch was bought by billionaire Robert Bigelow (Robert Bigelow is the owner of many organizations such as Bigelow Aerospace, National Institute for Discovery Science, Budget Suites of America. You can read more about it here<a href="robertbigelow.html"><button style="background-color:white; border-color:white;"><p style="font-size:15px; ">&#8592;Bigelow here</p></a></button>)
Bigelow eventually sold the Ranch for a relatively large amount to an unknown company that, like Bigelow, was supposed to conduct paranormal research there. At the time, no one knew what was going on at Skinwalker's Ranch or what the place looked like. The change came only after the Ranch was bought by civilians to turn it into a kind of scary amusement park. So everything on the Ranch was declassified, it was like civilians bought Area 51. It was very good news for ufologists. But then even more questions came. Why did the former researchers on the Ranch have a cow pen and a surveillance tower right next to it ?</h2>

<center><h2>So what do we know about the current owners? The current owner is a member of Space Wolf Research. His name is Brandon Fugal. Space Wolf Research is a real estate agency that also investigates UFOs and that was probably the reason why they got Skinwalker Ranch. The owners name is. What So, where is the game taking place? Fortunately, there is still public research going on. You can watch Skinwalker's Ranch on TV or live footage from the Ranch if you are willing to pay 10 dollars.</h2></center>
