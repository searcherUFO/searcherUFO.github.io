The directions in which we can move in the three-dimensional world are up, down, right, left, forward and backward. The universe we live in has three dimensions. In the world of gaming, you can also choose games with a two-dimensional universe. Games also called platformers were one of the first games, but times have changed and the games we play today are on a completely different level. Unreal engine and Unity have completely changed the way games are made these days. Nevertheless, let's look at all the advantages and disadvantages of 2D and 3D games.</h2></center>

<center><h1>2D game</h1></center>
<center><h2>A 2D game is good in that it is simple to program using HTML and JS. You can create a simple game on a canvas, but you can also create a more complex game. It depends on your knowledge of JavaScript and HTML. The big disadvantage of a 2D game is that you cannot create a map as big as in a 3D game. In a 2D game you can move in 4 directions but in 3D in 6. However, there are still many popular 2D games such as Agar. io. There are also games like Hungry Shark which are platform games but with 3D graphics. As for programs for creating 2D games, one of the most famous is probably Scratch.But you can also create a 2D or platform game in Unity.</h2></center>
<center><h1>3D game</h1></center>
<center><h2>3D games became popular at the ending of the 20th century, one of the first 3D games was wolfenstein. At the beginning of the 21th century, the first version of the Unreal Engine was also created. Unreal Engine is not the only 3D engine, there is Unity or Babylon.js and Three.js. These engines are improved every year so they have better graphics and controls.Sometimes it doesn't even matter if the game is 2D or 3D, it depends on the gameplay, if the game is good, if it is unique, all this will decide whether the game will be successful, games that have become legends like Pong, Snake, Pacman, Tetris mainly thanks to the fact that they were one of the first, but also because they were original.</h2></center><center><a href="welcome.html"><button class="link linkbutton">INFO</button></a><a href="bestthree.html"><button class="link linkbutton">TOP 3</button></a></center></div>
